# Week 1: HTML Tables

## Task 1 - Get the data
Find a dataset that has at least one quantitative column. Something with at least 50 rows would be ideal. Choose something of interest to you.

## Task 2 - Update index.html with your data
Edit the page title and description, and replace the data in the table with data from your dataset. (If your dataset has a cumbersome number of columns/rows, it would be perfectly fine to abridge it for this week; ten rows would be sufficient.)

## Task 3 - Make it beautiful
Use CSS to format the page to your liking, making at least two changes. You can add new styles to the STYLE element at the top of index.html, following the example which center-aligns the title and description. Also note that [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) has been included in this project, so check out the [documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) to learn about various features that you could take advantage of. (We'll learn more about Bootstrap in future weeks.)
